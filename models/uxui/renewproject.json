                "When talking through the sign up and purchasing workflow, there was a obstacle with native Webflow functionality, which added more steps to the sign up and purchasing purpose - a bad UX and reduces chances of a user successfully completing a purchase. I proposed to include a solution called Memberstack to handle user creation and auth. In addition, it easily links to Stripe, a popular payment processor. Memberstack cut down the users steps for signup/purchase by nearly half and allowed for optional email verification after a user's first time logging in. All of which reduces cart abandonment and customer support issues."
