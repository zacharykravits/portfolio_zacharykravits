        "I'm Clint, the owner of Clint's Coffee and I had the great luck of working with Zach as he redesigned my company logo and created all of my branding. Zach has the rare ability to be able to take vague ideas (mine) and turn them into a finished product that still has the feel I'm looking for while going way above and beyond what I had planned. He's one of the most creative people I've ever worked with and has the technical ability to bring his ideas to life. He also has a great attitude and never missed a beat if I asked him to change something or when I had to cancel a meeting with him on short notice. A true professional who always has a smile on his face."
