        "Zach's title of a UI/UX Designer doesn't encompass the full scope of all the work he was involved in. His UI/UX designs are incredible and I'd readily recommend him just for those alone, but there's a lot more to what he did for Idelic. He regularly wore the hat of a Product Manager/Owner as he was constantly working on defining requirements, building UI designs, and setting strategic direction. Zach was always open to being my sounding board and letting me bounce strategic agendas off of him. His feedback has been so valuable in shaping Idelic's Product offerings and helping us to grow as a company. He was always able to take rough requirements and turn them into UI designs that were clear and concise. He has the respect of everyone that he's worked with - internal and external. When Zach jumped on a call with clients, you knew you were in good hands with him helping to guide through challenging issues and getting customers to see exactly what we were doing and why. His adaptability to the audience was huge in dealing with some more difficult situations. I personally can't wait to see where he goes career wise and have a feeling that I will be reaching out to work for him at some point. He's got huge potential and shows it when given the opportunity to show what he can do.",
        "To anyone looking at him for future employment opportunities, I'd highly recommend taking a chance on him even if others have more experience as he constantly impressed everyone with what he can do and rises to the challenge."
